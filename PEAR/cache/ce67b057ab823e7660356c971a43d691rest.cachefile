Provides
cleaner API and pluggable Adapters:
  * Socket adapter, based on old HTTP_Request code,
  * Curl adapter, wraps around PHP's cURL extension,
  * Mock adapter, to use for testing packages dependent on HTTP_Request2.
Supports POST requests with data and file uploads, basic and digest 
authentication, cookies, managing cookies across requests, proxies, gzip and
deflate encodings, redirects, monitoring the request progress with Observers...";s:2:"da";s:19:"2011-02-27 22:04:13";s:1:"n";s:664:"Additions and changes:
  * Implemented cookie jar that allows to store and pass cookies across HTTP
    requests (see request #18225)
  * Added several specialized subclasses of HTTP_Request2_Exception, they are
    now thrown instead of the parent. Also added error codes and possibility
    to get native error code (as returned by stream_socket_client() and 
    curl_errno()) (request #16762)
  * An additional 'sentBody' event is now sent to Observers (request #16828) 
  * setBody() and addUpload() can now accept file pointers (request #16863)

Bugfixes:
  * Incorrect check in Socket Adapter prevented Keep-alive from working in
    some cases (bug #17031)";s:1:"f";s:5:"94516";s:1:"g";s:48:"http://pear.php.net/get/HTTP_Request2-2.0.0beta1";s:1:"x";a:1:{s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:10:"xlink:href";s:22:"package.2.0.0beta1.xml";}}}
